# Zoe vidmaster ![Agent version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zoe_Agent-0.1.0-blue.svg "Zoe vidmaster")

Automated video edition capabilities for Zoe.

This agent has a static copy of [vidmaster](https://github.com/rmed/vidmaster) and uses it as an additional library for performing the compositions.

**This agent only works on 32 and 64 bit architectures due to the `imageio` module. This means that it does not work on Raspberry Pi or similar devices.**
